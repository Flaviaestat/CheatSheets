Level of significance: It is the probability of making a wrong decision. 
In the above hypothesis statement, null hypothesis indicates no difference between sample and population mean. 
Say there’s a 5% risk of rejecting the null hypothesis when there is no difference between the sample and population mean. 
This risk or probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it’s true is called level of significance.

The term significance level (alpha) is used to refer to a pre-chosen probability and the term "P value" is used to indicate a 
probability that you calculate after a given study
